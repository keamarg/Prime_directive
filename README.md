# Prime Directive

A narrative choice-based game where you observe a developing civilization and decide when to intervene.

## Description

In Prime Directive, you control an alien spacecraft observing a young civilization's development over three eons. Your choices about when to intervene, guide gently, or remain silent will shape the fate of this world along three aspects: Truth, Happiness, and Autonomy.

The results of your decisions will be reflected in the monitors on your spacecraft and ultimately determine which of the 10 possible endings the civilization reaches.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Click "Begin Observation" to start
3. Read each dilemma and choose one of four responses:
   - Intervene (direct action)
   - Guide Gently (subtle influence)
   - Remain Silent (passive observation)
   - Do Nothing (natural decay continues)
4. Watch how your choices affect the three aspects
5. After three questions per eon, see narrative snippets about how the civilization is developing
6. After three eons, discover which of the 10 possible endings your decisions led to
